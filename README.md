### 3. Configure the Application

1. Edit the `config.ini` file with your settings:

```ini
[EMAIL]
smtp_server = smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port = 587
smtp_username = your_email@gmail.com
smtp_password = your_app_password
sender_name = PI USB Data Safegate

[CLOUD_STORAGE]
provider = nextcloud

- Create a Dropbox app at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
- Generate an access token
- Add the token to the config file

## Usage

### 1. Start the Application

```bash
# Run with root privileges (required for USB access)
sudo python3 main.py
```

### 2. Using the GUI

1. **Select USB Drive**: Choose from detected USB drives in the dropdown
2. **Enter Email**: Provide your email address for notifications
3. **Click "Scan and Upload"**: Start the process
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time status updates
5. **Check Email**: Receive download link when complete

### 3. Process Flow

1. **USB Detection**: Application scans for connected USB drives
2. **Malware Scanning**: ClamAV scans all files on the selected drive
3. **File Processing**: Safe files are zipped for transfer
4. **Cloud Upload**: Zip file is uploaded to configured cloud storage
5. **Email Notification**: Download link is sent to user's email
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Files are deleted after 7 days

## Security Features

- **Malware Detection**: All files are scanned before upload
- **Quarantine System**: Infected files are isolated
- **Secure Transfer**: Files are compressed and uploaded via HTTPS
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No files remain permanently on cloud storage
- **Access Control**: Requires root privileges for USB access

## Configuration Options

### Email Settings
- **smtp_server**: SMTP server address
- **smtp_port**: SMTP port (usually 587 for TLS)
- **smtp_username**: Email account username
- **smtp_password**: Email account password or app password
- **sender_name**: Display name for outgoing emails

### Cloud Storage Settings
- **provider**: Choose 'nextcloud' or 'dropbox'
- **nextcloud_url**: Full URL to your Nextcloud instance
- **nextcloud_username**: Nextcloud username
- **nextcloud_password**: Nextcloud password
- **nextcloud_upload_path**: Directory for uploads
- **dropbox_access_token**: Dropbox API access token

### Security Settings
- **clamav_db_path**: Path to ClamAV virus database
- **max_file_size_mb**: Maximum file size to scan (MB)
- **quarantine_infected**: Whether to quarantine infected files

### Cleanup Settings
- **auto_delete_days**: Days before automatic deletion
- **cleanup_check_interval_hours**: How often to check for cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ClamAV not found"**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon
   sudo freshclam
   ```

2. **"Permission denied" for USB**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 main.py
   ```

3. **"No USB drives found"**
   - Ensure USB drive is properly connected
   - Check if drive is mounted: `lsblk`
   - Try different USB port

4. **Email sending fails**
   - Check email credentials in config.ini
   - Verify SMTP settings
   - For Gmail, use app password instead of regular password

5. **Cloud upload fails**
   - Verify cloud storage credentials
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure upload directory exists

### Log Files

The application creates detailed logs in `safegate.log`:
- Startup and shutdown events
- USB drive detection
- Malware scan results
- Upload progress
- Email notifications
- Error messages

### Testing Connections

You can test your configuration by checking the log files after startup. The application will test:
- ClamAV availability
- Email server connection
- Cloud storage access
